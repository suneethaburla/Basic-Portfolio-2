            <p>Hey there! Thank you for visiting my profile! My name is Suneetha Burla and I am a Technical Program Manager by 
                profession and have been in the Program/Project Management for past 10 years. Besides Program Management, it's my passion and dream 
                to learn coding and web development. Through UC Berkely Coding Bootcamp, I aspire to become a full stack web 
                developer and build some great looking websites!
            </p>
            <p>As a program manager, I have extensively worked on the implementation of complex strategic and high visibility 
                business initiatives on mobile app (iOS and Android), mobile web and tablet web applications. 
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy doing community services and actively volunteer for non profit organizations such as art of living 
                and International association for human values. Other interests include personality development, leadership, 
                spirituality and mindfulness. I like travelling, cooking, reading books and watching inspirational videos and knowledge talks.
            </p>
